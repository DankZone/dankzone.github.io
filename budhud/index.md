# We wanted to make something extraordinary. We wondered, were do we start?

Our version of budHUD isn't some kind of rip off from the original. We want to make some great, something big. The question is, where do we start?
Team Fortress 2 has a _ton_ of customizability and it would be a terrible waste to just leave it in the wind. So we caught it, and we are holding on to it.

As YouTuber [Surny](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiWQxro1IaCTOJBJA21Icfg) said: "Once TF2 has sunken it's nails into you, it's not letting you go."

TF2 is neglected by the gaming community, and in doing so, Valve as also neglected it even though it plays a huge part in their income.<br/>
TF2 is just old news. But just because it's old, doesn't mean it stays old.<br/>
<br/>
We hope our small HUD repository, can become something as big as Muselk (or even Ali-a). It's just a matter of time.
