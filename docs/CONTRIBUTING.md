# Contributing to The Dank Zone Website

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to our website. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

The Dank Zone Website is open-source, that means anyone is allowed contribute to it. However your work will first be checked before it is merged.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.


## Looking for support?

Check out [our Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/gwamp7n) or drop us an email dankzonediscord@gmail.com.

## How to report a bug

Think you found a bug? Please check [the list of open issues](https://github.com/DankZone/dankzone.github.io/issues) to see if your bug has already been reported. If it hasn't please [submit a new issue](https://github.com/DankZone/dankzone.github.io/issues/new).

Here are a few tips for writing *great* bug reports:

* Describe the specific problem (e.g., "widget doesn't turn clockwise" versus "getting an error")
* Include the steps to reproduce the bug, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead
* Only include one bug per issue. If you have discovered two bugs, please file two issues
* Even if you don't know how to fix the bug, including a failing test may help others track it down

**If you find a security vulnerability, do not open an issue. Please email dankzonediscord@gmail.com instead.**

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and goals of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince us of the merits of your feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible, including describing the problem you're trying to solve.

[Open an issue](https://github.com/DankZone/dankzone.github.io/issues/new) which describes the feature you would like to see, why you want it, how it should work, etc. Please and 'Feature Request' or 'Enhancement' to the front of your issue name.



## Your first contribution

We'd love for you to contribute to the project. Unsure where to begin contributing to our website? You can start by looking through these "good first issue" and "help wanted" issues:

* [Good first issues](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code and a test or two
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which may be a bit more involved, but are specifically seeking community contributions

*p.s. Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first*

## How to propose changes

Here's a few general guidelines for proposing changes:

* If you are making visual changes, include a screenshot of what the affected element looks like, both before and after.
* Follow the [Jekyll style guide](https://ben.balter.com/jekyll-style-guide).
* If you are changing any user-facing functionality, please be sure to update the documentation
* Each pull request should implement **one** feature or bug fix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request
* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bug fix
* Don't bump the version number in your pull request (it will be bumped prior to release)
* Write [a good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)

At a high level, [the process for proposing changes](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) is:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/DankZone/dankzone.github.io/fork) and clone the project
2. Configure and install the dependencies: `script/bootstrap`
3. Make sure the tests pass on your machine: `script/cibuild`
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
5. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass
6. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/DankZone/dankzone.github.io//compare)
7. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged
