## Welcome to the Dank Zone Discord server website

<p>Site currently in development.
This is a website made for <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/gwamp7n">our Discord server</a>.

These days a Discord server can be anything. It can go from the totally normal gaming, to virtual churches praising the lord Gaben.

But our server is neither of those. We are a community of gamers built around the original purpose. This is a Discord server for a YouTube channel.</br>
Don't click off yet! Because I still need to get you into our server. So stick around.

We have a brief explanation of our Discord server in our <a href="./about.html">about page</a>.</br>
When you join our server we will almost always have an Admin to welcome you and show you around.</br>
We have special roles on our server for people with selected linked accounts (eg: Gamer for linked Steam account)

We have text channels for almost everything so you can talk about anything.</br>
If you want to talk to a human then we have a few voice channels that are added and removed based on demand.

<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/gwamp7n">Join Now!</a></p>
