## Welcome to the Dank Zone Discord server website

<p>Site currently in development.
This is a website made for <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/gwamp7n">our Discord server</a>.<br>

These days a Discord server can be anything.<br>
But our server is neither of those. This server is focused on a building a gaming (and meme) community. The original concept was to be a server only for YouTobe viewers, but we've expanded that goal to maybe one day create an esports team from just our Discord server.
Don't click off yet! Because we still need to get you into our server. So stick around.<br>
<br>
We have a brief explanation of our Discord server in our <a href="./about.html">about page</a>.<br>
When you join our server we will almost always have an Admin to welcome you and show you around.<br>
We have special roles on our server for people with selected linked accounts (eg: Gamer for linked Steam account)<br>
<br>
We have text channels for almost everything so you can talk about anything.<br>
If you want to talk to a human then we have a few voice channels that are added and removed based on demand.<br>
<br>
